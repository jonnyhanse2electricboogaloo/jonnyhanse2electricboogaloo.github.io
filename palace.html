<h3>you go to the king at the palace, but he quickly refuses you. you attempt to tell him who you are, but he refuses to see a disowned noble. at least he gave you some inhaler fluid. you decide that despite this, you need to stop your parents. you know that they will strike soon, and you need to be ready. You figure that the best thing to do is head to the tavern and recruit some mercenaries. you  get there, and find a group of mercs willing to work for you. they are joel, dick, hugh, abdul, hank, stan, and jamal. do you go to the city walls to repel your parent's attack or protect the king at the palace? </h3>
