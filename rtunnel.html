<h3>you take the right tunnel. you come to a room where an old man is sitting. "hello jim" he says. "I am your uncle, phil pickens. like you I was banished, for low bone density. But before I was forced out, I discovered in your parents bedroom a map, which revealed to me their plot to take over all of suganda. now go, destroy this evil plot, I'm getting tired of speaking, and both my legs are shattered. now go!" "uhhhhhhh ok lol" you reply and leave. at the door of the armory are 3 frogpeople assassins, which are probably sent by your parents. what do you do?</h3>
